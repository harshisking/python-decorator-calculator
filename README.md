> ## 🚀 Secure Calculator with Python Decorators 🧮🔐  
> This is a simple CLI-based calculator app written in Python that demonstrates the power of **decorators**. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations but includes multiple layers of functionality using custom decorators.

>  
> ### 🧠 Features  
> - **Login System**: Only registered users can access the calculator.  
> - **Input Validation**: Checks if inputs are valid numbers.  
> - **Execution Timer**: Measures how long each operation takes.  
> - **Logging**: All operations are logged in `logs.txt` with user details.
